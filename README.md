## Profile

I am a developer working across front-end engineering, game development, and systems programming.  
My approach is straightforward: understand fundamentals, build consistently, and refine through iteration.

I work primarily with JavaScript/React and C++, while expanding into backend engineering and Linux-based workflows.  
My background in video editing and design gives me a practical eye for motion, timing, and user experience.
